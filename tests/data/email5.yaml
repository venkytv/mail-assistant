    Not Based on a True Story
    Jason Okundaye
    ‘Adolescence has been compared to Mr Bates v. The Post Office, last year’s
    ITV series that dramatised the Post Office Horizon scandal and provoked a
    government response, with Rishi Sunak announcing legislation to exonerate
    postmasters who had been wrongly convicted and offering thousands in
    compensation. Government by television show is a depressing prospect. What
    does it take to get any kind of action on long-standing issues in this
    country? A compelling lead actor? A child plucked from obscurity giving the
    performance of his life?’
